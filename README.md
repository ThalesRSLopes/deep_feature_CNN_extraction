# Deep feature extraction
Deep features are numerical descriptors obteined from a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and they are used for the recognition and classification task. This values can be extrated from the model and used for transfer learning.

This code use hooks to extract the deep features from an image given to AlexNet or ResNet-50.
